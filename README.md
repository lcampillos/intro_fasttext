# Introduction to fastText
The presentation by Piotr Bojanowski gives you a detailed overview of the tool.

The other presentation summarizes the features of fastText and provides examples using data for BioNLP.

The folder `data` contains:
* `act1`: instructions, data and scripts for an activity to explore the effect of character n-grams or window size.
* `act2`: instructions and data for an activity to learn to use fastText in a supervised context.
